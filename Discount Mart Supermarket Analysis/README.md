Discount mart is a small supermarket owned by Grant Frost. 
He wants a dashboard where he can track how well Discount 
Mart is doing for this year (in terms of Sales, Profit and 
Quantity Sold). He would also like to know how well categories
are performing as well as different regions. Grant Frost assumes 
that most customers buy 2 or more products per basket/order 
but would like this confirmed by the data. 
Grant also noted that Profit is 30% of the selling price.

Here we analyzed Discount Mart data using Tableau as a
business intelligence tool
